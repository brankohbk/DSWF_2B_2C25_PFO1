        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>
          A tech enthusiast for as long as I can remember, I found a new passion
          for IT when I got my first PC at 12. Since then, I have dived deeper
          into how to set up and fix computers, and build new Software, bringing
          solutions to more than a thousand customers between SMEs, big
          companies, and domestic users throughout my career.
        </p>
        <p>
          Always eager to learn, I am looking to be part of a team where we can
          work together to create solutions for the end user and where I can
          share my coding and management expertise.

            <li>
              I founded this IT support business that increased the productivity

          <h5>Selected project: Intelliflo Office</h5>
          <p>
            Using .NET, Kendo UI, applying the CQRS pattern, and organizing
            tasks and docs with Azure DevOps and Jira, I participated in the
            development of "Intelliflo Office", a tool used by big financial
            institutions to manage investors&apos; wealth. Intelliflo is a company
            that provides solutions supporting over 30,000 financial
            professionals worldwide, representing over three million end
            investors, with over $1 trillion (US) advised across their
            platforms.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              I participated in developing user views and modals such as:
              Trading Exceptions, Trading orders, and Advisor dashboard, among
              others.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed widgets with jQuery and Kendo UI, such as: tables with
              filter and grouping features, masked inputs, redacted
              date-pickers, customizing the ones that Kendo UI offers and
              expanding them, making the workflow much easier and more secure
              for the final user.
            </li>
            <li>
              I made videos and documentation teaching new hires how to set up
              their laptops and how to use the product we were working on, so
              their onboarding was as smooth and quick as possible.
